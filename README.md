# Gameplay Programming Patterns Assignment
Create a Mac Unity project for your top-down arena shooter (think of Geometry Wars, Robotron or Everyday Shooter). For next week implement a the following features:

1. Top-down Static View
2. Player: A player controlled avatar that can:
    (1) The avatar can be moved via keyboard key:rightarrow, leftarrow, uparrow, and downarrow.
    (2) The player can shoot bullets via keyboard key:space. And the bullet will only exist 1.5 second and then be destroyed.
3. Arena Bounds: The avatar is constrained to move within the plane(play area).
